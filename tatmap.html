<h3>BRIEFING</h3>    
    <b><h4>Introduction and Problem</h4></b>
    You've been thinking about a tattoo for months but don't know where to start. What if I get it done and regret it? Tattoo apps on the market aren't exactly helping you to make a commitment to get the ink done. So do you make the choice to regret nothing or everything?
    <b><h4>Proposed Solution</h4></b>
    Create an app that helps users to reduce regret by guiding them through a tattoo journey from beginning to end while acting as a personal assistant. Also known as TatMap.
    <b><h4>My role</h4></b>
    All elements of UX (focus) and UI.
    <b><h4>Timeline</h4></b>
    June 2018 - January 2019.
    <b><h4>Final Prototype</h4></b>

    <h3>THE PROCESS (summarized)</h3>    
    <p>The following were done to gain insight to know what people who want to get inked really want to see in an app:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Competitive Anaylsis</li>
    <li>Discovery Phase</li>
    <li>Research</li>
    <li>Persona Creation</li>
    <li>User Flows</li>
    <li>Creation of Low, Mid, and High Fidelity Mockups</li>
    <li>User Testing</li>
    <li>Gap Analysis</li>
    <li>Iteration Process</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h3><b>HOW WAS THE PROBLEM SOLVED?</b></h3>
    <p>Users really wanted help with finding a tattoo that suited their needs and assistance with the journey that comes after commitment. So creating an assistant type app that would leave a user from beginning to the end of their journey, step by step, would be exceedingly useful. With that in mind, elements such as an artist page for their portfolio, studios that showed reviews from other tattooees, assistance with making an appointment, and ways to reach out to a studio and artist were implimented.</p>
</div>
    <div>
    <h3><b>WHAT ROADBLOCKS WERE HIT?</b></h3>
    <p>Through the design learning process, desktop native elements were being used on a mobile device, so that was one major change.</p>
    <p>Another major change was nagivation. The search function acted as a homepage, which confused the users. This was a high usability issue when it came to testing.</p>
    <p>Both of these major issues triggered a gap anaylsis and thus the iteration process was taken under again.</p>
