        <b>My goal</b>: To become an UX Designer and Writer within an innovative space where creativity and appreciation is
free flowing, employee growth and potential is maximized, and advocacy of a positive work-life balance is prioritized.
<br><br><b>My mission</b>: Apply ten plus years worth of skills and experience to creating and enriching user experiences and
fall in love with problems that need solutions. To achieve this, I am looking to engage myself with companies
with meaningful missions to resolving user pain points in any aspect of their lives. With this, we will make the
world a better place, one user at a time.

      <p>
        <b>Who am I?</b>: I am a platform gamer, photographer), voice over, workshop and panelist lead, audio drama script
writer, and audio mixing engineer.
<br><br>Just some of the parts that make me whole.
<br><br>All the paths Iâ€™ve taken in life have finally led to tech and UX. I have an arsenal of skills ready to be applied to
user problems and a company's mission. Creative and technical writing, adaptability, time management, conflict
resolution, and being an open communicator are just a few of the skills that help me view the world differently,
opening up possibilities and various ways to look at a situation. I seek to fight for the users and keep them in
mind during the decision making process.
